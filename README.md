This extension embeds the Android emulators running on your system inside a tool window of Visual Studio.

## Download from Visual Studio Marketplace

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adospace.vs-android-em

## Features

It automatically detects current emulators and monitors new ones as they are activated. It can handle more than one emulator window, rapidly switching between them.

Main features:

- Automatically resizing of the emulator window as you resize the container,
- Support for portrait/landscape mode.
- Show/Hide emulators toolbar
- Ability to close the emulator with or without saving its internal state

Show the Emulator Preview Window from View->Other Windows->Android Emulator Previewer

Even if I tested it with different configurations and PCs, it shouldn't be considered yet production ready.
